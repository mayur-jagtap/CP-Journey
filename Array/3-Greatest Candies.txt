Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 

my sol:

bool* kidsWithCandies(int* candies, int candiesSize, int extraCandies, int* returnSize){
    int i,max = candies[0];
    bool* output = malloc(candiesSize * sizeof(int));
    for(i=0;i<candiesSize;i++){
        if(candies[i] > max){
            max=candies[i];
        }
    }
    
    for(i=0;i<candiesSize;i++){
        if((candies[i] + extraCandies) < max){
            output[i] = false;
        }else{
            output[i] = true;
        }
    }
    
        *returnSize = candiesSize;
        return output;
}



Best sol:

bool* kidsWithCandies(int* candies, int candiesSize, int extraCandies, int* returnSize){
    int i;
    int max = 0;
    *returnSize = candiesSize;
    bool *boolArray = (bool*)malloc(sizeof(bool)*candiesSize);
    for (i = 0; i < candiesSize; i++){
        if (max < candies[i]){
            max = candies[i];
        }
    }
    for (i = 0; i < candiesSize; i++){
        if (candies[i] + extraCandies >= max){
            boolArray[i] = true;
        }
        else{
            boolArray[i] = false;
        }
    }
    return boolArray;
